Here we have an Observer pattern example. I took as an example a change in the rate of a cryptocurrency,
specifically bitcoin rate. I used 3 interfaces, for subject - observer and 1 for display information.
When the bitcoin rate changes, investors will be notified. I combined the knowledge from the book and
the knowledge that I received from lessons.
